# deadsea

Deadsea is a minimal library that helps prevent scroll-into fever
with maps on the internet.

It's abstracted from mapping frameworks; it operates on DOM elements.
But its tested to work in Modest Maps and Google Maps API v3.

# Compatibility

* Safari ~5

This code doesn't do anything on IE - it doesn't break the browser,
but also doesn't fix any problems.
